Consider a set of N agents that, at each time step t, interact according to a NxN probability matrix q_ab with a \in 1..N. Write a code in R such that one can design a set of M probability matrices such that it is possible to determine K arbitrary subgroups with a given probability of interaction p_i within each subgroup, i.e. i \in 1...K, and with probabilities of interaction between subgroups p_ik with i,k \in 1..K.
